## About me

Initially, I did not think about writing programs because I got  a degree in a completely different field.
I chose to study front-end development since it is, in fact, the first step in becoming a web developer. 
I am fascinated by how browsers transform lines of code into something beautiful and dynamic. 
It is interesting and easy to learn, and the field of web programming is constantly growing and changing. 
Also, debugging is a good attention and intelligence training.
**I am a very ambitious person, and I do not let myself rest on the laurels. I am fond of figuring out mysteries.
I am not afraid of facing difficult problems because, in my opinion, there is nothing impossible.
I never lack motivation, confidence, and tenacity**
